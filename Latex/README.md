I am using two different Docker containers, one based on `ubuntu:focal` and the other on `alpine`, to run `LaTeX` environments.


Upon attaching the container with Visual Studio Code, proceed to install the following extensions to enhance your LaTeX editing experience:

1. `mathematic.vscode-latex`: This extension provides a comprehensive set of tools for LaTeX editing, including syntax highlighting, snippets, and more.

2. `James-Yu.latex-workshop`: This extension offers a full LaTeX development environment with features such as building, viewing, and linting LaTeX documents.

To install these extensions, search for their respective identifiers in the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X) in VS Code and click on the 'Install' button for each.
